** About
   This is but a personal config.
** Installation
   Just put it in =~/.config/emacs=
** Emacs as a server
   I tend to run Emacs in server mode. It migth be convenient to have a systemd
   user unit for that:

   #+begin_src
[Unit]
Description=Emacs Daemon

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(progn (setq kill-emacs-hook 'nil)(kill-emacs))"
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
   #+end_src

   Just put it in =~/.config/systemd/emacs.service=
   You can then enable it with

   ~$ systemctl --user enable emacs~
** Key bindings
   This config doesn't change Emacs' classic key bindings. Instead, I like to
   remap my system-wide keyboard layout. Namely, I replace =Caps Lock= with
   =Left Ctrl=, and =Left Ctrl= with =Hyper=. This doesn't only give me the more
   convenient placement of Ctrl key, but also provides me with additional
   keyboard modifier.

   To achieve this behaviour, put this config in =~/.Xmodmap=:
   #+begin_src
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
remove mod4 = Hyper_L
keysym Control_L = Hyper_L
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Control = Control_L
add mod3 = Hyper_L
   #+end_src
